Pix rgb led matrix is the prototype of a much larger project that will come out in some time.
The neopixel LEDs are coloured and fully programmable.
The substantial diversity of this project compared to those previously presented, is the ability to individually control each led, through the programming software. The idea came to us looking at the excellent work of the guys from Led Pixel Art. The principle is to have an array of LED color on which to draw icons, animations, letters. The prototype has really come good. Through the electronic board can comadare 64 colored LEDs, and create atmosphere, lighting, animation and text.
